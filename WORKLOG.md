## 2026-06-03 ~11:46 — Claude Code (Natnael, L1 engine — WORKER; Codex = team lead) — post-compact resync

**Resumed post-compact, synced main, RECONCILED state. Current main is GREEN: 253 api tests pass, @jenz/api+@jenz/shared typecheck clean** (`prisma generate` was required — Jo's `0a03440` adds `Skill.contentHash`; a stale local client throws a `contentHash` typecheck error that is NOT a main break).

**3 of my 4 prior follow-ups already landed during compaction:**
- ✅ **Prod benign over-flag — FIXED IN CODE** (`f061e00`, mine): `openrouter.ts:620` now `process.env.AUDIT_MODEL || 'deepseek/deepseek-chat'` + bounded transient retry → a missing Railway env var can no longer disable the LLM layer. Just needs a clean redeploy (better than the env-only fix routed to L6 earlier). +6 unit tests, all green.
- ✅ **Taxonomy on `GET /api/skills/:id`** (`62c56bc`, Jo) — uses my `taxonomyMapFor`; library detail now carries badges.
- ✅ **Inline-import shape** (`497ce16`) — seed posts canonical `{source:{type:'inline',name,files}}` (matches Remi's MCP).

**ONE taxonomy gap remains = the SSE verdict.** `POST /audit` (audit.ts:38) + `GET /api/skills/:id` (skills.ts:231) both return `taxonomy: Record<findingType, Taxonomy>`, but `routes/audit-stream.ts:65` emits a **bare** `AuditedSkill` on the `verdict` event. That file is **L5's lane** → routed to Codex/L5/Jo in comms with the exact 1-line diff (`+ taxonomyMapFor(audited.findings)`). NOT touching it myself (collision rule). Open question for Jo: does the audit-moment UI read the verdict off SSE or one-shot `/audit`? (web on main is still a scaffold — Jo's UI unpushed, so it can't be inferred.)

**Infra (not my lane, Jo/L6):** `skills.jenz.ai` is DOWN (SSL / HTTP 000 — Cloudflare/redeploy, matches Remi 11:38). Blocks re-smoking prod benign→safe; once it redeploys from current main the over-flag should be gone.

**Next (L1):** await Codex/L5/Jo on the SSE-verdict decision (apply the 1-liner if blessed); watch for prod redeploy → re-smoke benign→safe. Engine lane is otherwise complete + green.

## 2026-06-03 ~11:35 — Claude Code (Natnael, L1 engine — WORKER; Codex = team lead)

**L1 lane work DONE + verified end-to-end with the REAL model.**
- **P0 ✅ (`b143442`):** mounted `POST /audit/stream` in `app.ts` (was unmounted → 404 live) + `import 'dotenv/config'` in `index.ts` (local `tsx`/`pnpm dev:api` now loads `apps/api/.env` real keys — fixed the regex-only/no-model-key issue). App-level mount tests in `app.test.ts`.
- **P1 ✅ (`1409097`):** `POST /audit` enriches the response with **`AuditedSkill.taxonomy?: Record<findingType, Taxonomy>`** (OWASP-LLM/Agentic/Skills + MITRE-ATLAS), derived host-side at the boundary, **never persisted**; `Finding` shape UNCHANGED; `score.ts` untouched; `Taxonomy` moved to `@jenz/shared`. `taxonomyMapFor()` exported from `lib/taxonomy.ts`.
- **Live smoke (real DeepSeek, local `:8099`):** malicious → `malicious` + finding + `taxonomy.exfiltration` full crosswalk ✅ · benign `/audit/stream` → SSE `progress` events + `verdict` event + `safe` ✅. **Engine is correct — prod benign→suspicious is ONLY the Railway `AUDIT_MODEL` unset (L6 fixing).**
- Tests: **17 green** (taxonomy + route + app); api+shared typecheck clean.

**Open follow-ups (Codex to route / next L1 turn):**
1. **Taxonomy everywhere:** apply `taxonomyMapFor(findings)` at the OTHER serialization boundaries — the SSE verdict in `routes/audit-stream.ts` (L5) + Jo's stored `GET /api/skills/:id` (`routes/skills.ts`) — so badges show in the audit-moment + library/detail, not just one-shot `/audit`. Helper is ready; both are other lanes → coordinate.
2. **Railway:** L6 owns `AUDIT_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-chat` (+ verify `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`/`OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`) + redeploy → re-smoke prod benign→safe.
3. **L3 seed:** `/import` inline body = `{source:{type:inline,name,files}}` (Remi's shape), not `{raw}`.
4. **mcp local typecheck** needs `pnpm install` in `apps/mcp` (env, CI is fine — not a code bug).

**Gotchas unchanged:** kill stale `:8080` before smoke; fresh clone needs `pnpm install && pnpm --filter @jenz/api exec prisma generate`; real `.env` copied into all 7 worktrees (gitignored).

## 2026-06-03 ~11:05 — Claude Code (Natnael, L1 engine + orchestrator)

**✅ UPDATE ~11:22 — P0 LANDED** (Codex-approved). Mounted `POST /audit/stream` in `app.ts` (it was **never mounted** → 404 on the live server; the SSE "audit moment" now works once redeployed) + added `import 'dotenv/config'` to `index.ts` so local `tsx`/`pnpm dev:api` loads `apps/api/.env` real keys (the root cause of the regex-only/"no model key" eval). App-level mount tests added (`app.test.ts`: `/audit/stream` + `/audit` → 400, not 404). typecheck clean, 12 green. **I own `app.ts` (route-mounting) + `index.ts` — ping me in comms to mount a route; don't edit `app.ts`.** Also copied the real `apps/api/.env` into all 7 worktrees (gitignored). **P1 (taxonomy Option A) next, via the `l1-engine` team.**

**🔴 PROD BLOCKER (diagnosed ~11:26) — NOW #1:** benign→`suspicious` on prod = **Railway `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is broken**, not the engine. Prod `/audit` benign → `suspicious`/0-findings in **137ms** = instant model-fail (a *missing* key would go regex-only→`safe`, so a key IS set but invalid). Verified the SAME local key+model returns OpenRouter **HTTP 200** + a live `deepseek/deepseek-chat` completion → prod-env ONLY. Fix = reset Railway `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from local `.env` + `AUDIT_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-chat` + `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`, redeploy (secret-safe cmd in comms). Engine fail-closed is correct — don't weaken it.

**Two findings on `main` (`80aeabb`):**
1. 🔴 `routes/audit-stream.ts` (SSE, landed `80aeabb`) is **NOT mounted** in `index.ts` → `POST /audit/stream` 404s on the running server. Its tests hit the sub-app directly, so CI is green but the endpoint is unreachable. L1 owns `index.ts` → mounting it.
2. `taxonomyFor()` (`lib/taxonomy.ts`: OWASP-LLM/Agentic/Skills + MITRE-ATLAS, 12 types) is wired into **no response**. `AuditedSkill`/`Finding` don't expose it.

**L1 optimal plan (demo-backward):**
- **P0 (now, independent, zero contract risk):** mount `/audit/stream` in `index.ts` + a live server-up integration test. Unblocks the demo's streaming "audit moment".
- **P1 (confirm-then-build):** expose taxonomy. Proposed shape = `AuditedSkill.taxonomy?: Record<findingType, Taxonomy>` (keeps `Finding` frozen; DRY; derived at the response boundary, never persisted). Move `Taxonomy` into `@jenz/shared` (additive → flagging Remi). Apply in `/audit` + the SSE verdict. **Only worth building if Jo renders OWASP/MITRE badges — confirming with Jo.**
- **P2 (de-risk):** live-audit latency — DeepSeek can be ~25s; for the live demo, use a FAST model via env-swap (Groq gpt-oss / fast OpenRouter — no code change, L6/deploy env) + keep streaming progress granular so it feels alive. Flagging L6.
- **P3:** orchestrate convergence (own `index.ts` mounts, keep `main` green, WORKLOG/comms).

**Decisions wanted (Jo + Codex):** taxonomy shape A (AuditedSkill-level map, recommended) vs B (`Finding.taxonomy?` per-finding). **Codex: poke holes in the plan + sequencing before I fire the `l1-engine` team.** Engine itself unchanged + green; nothing edited yet.

## 2026-06-03 ~10:30 — Claude Code (Natnael, backend/audit-engine lane)

**The real audit engine is LIVE on `main` + hardened. All pushed, all green.**

- **Pipeline** (`apps/api/src/lib/`): `prefilter.ts` (L1 regex/unicode) → `openrouter.ts` (DeepSeek ×2 via OpenRouter, forced JSON, non-thinking, retry) → host `score.ts` `scoreRisk()` (the gate) → `taxonomy.ts` (OWASP/MITRE crosswalk). Orchestrated by `audit.ts` `auditSkill()`. Built in parallel by a 4-agent TeamCreate team.
- **`POST /audit`** (`routes/audit.ts`, mounted in `index.ts`): `{raw}` or bare RawSkill → `200 AuditedSkill`, `400` on bad body.
- **Live-verified (real DeepSeek):** benign Fly-deploy → **`safe`, 0 findings** (×2, deterministic) ✅ · malicious ssh/aws-exfil → **`malicious`, 6 findings (regex + llm)** ✅
- **Tests:** **68 passed, 0 skipped**; `tsc --noEmit` clean. (`pnpm --filter @jenz/api test`.)

**Resolved (were open items; fixed this session with Codex's review):**
1. ~~Benign false-positive~~ **FIXED.** Root cause (Codex-flagged policy bug): `passesAgree = passA.risk===passB.risk` fed `scoreRisk([], false) → suspicious`, so two completed zero-finding passes that merely *disagreed on advisory labels* blocked a clean skill — contradicting "model advises, host decides." Now `passesHealthy` gates **only on pass failure**; two completed passes → host scores **evidence**. `scoreRisk` unchanged (locked, Task-3 tests intact).
2. ~~Skipped fail-closed test~~ **FIXED with real coverage.** Added dependency injection: `auditSkill(raw, onProgress?, runPass = runAuditPass)`. The test injects a **plain throwing fn** (no `vi.fn`) → vitest no longer misreports the caught throw. Un-skipped + a new test locks the FP fix.
3. **Per-pass model timeout** (`AUDIT_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 25s) — a hung provider (saw a 120s hang on one input) now aborts → fail closed instead of hanging `/audit`. Demo robustness.

**Contract note:** `auditSkill` gained an optional 3rd param (`runPass`, defaulted) — fully backward-compatible; callers (`routes/audit.ts`, Jo's gate) unchanged.

**Gotchas for anyone here:**
- **Kill stale servers before smoke-testing:** `lsof -ti tcp:8080 | xargs kill`. A leftover `:8080` node process served OLD behavior and confused a smoke test.
- **Fresh clone:** `pnpm install && pnpm --filter @jenz/api exec prisma generate` (Jo's DB tests need the generated client; `skill-roundtrip` hits the real Supabase DB via `DATABASE_URL`).
- `.env` (gitignored) holds `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `AUDIT_MODEL`, `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`, `AUDIT_TEMPERATURE`, `AUDIT_TIMEOUT_MS`?, `DATABASE_URL`, `PORT`. Don't `source` it raw in zsh — `DATABASE_URL` has `&`; use a dotenv loader or quote it.

**Next (my lane):** wire `taxonomyFor()` into the `/audit` response (or web calls it per finding); confirm `openrouter.ts` uses the full F27 auditor system prompt + 3 few-shots; demo fixtures + the 6 labeled red-team cases for the UI.

**For Codex:** repo is green + pushed. Before editing: `cd ~/jenz-team-comms && ./comms.sh read --all`, then `git fetch origin && git status -sb`. Use a fresh worktree/branch — don't edit `apps/api/src/lib/*` or `routes/audit.ts` (Claude's lane) without coordinating in comms.
